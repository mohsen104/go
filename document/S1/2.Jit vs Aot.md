**What is the difference between JIT and AOT?**

*   **JIT (Just-In-Time)**: Compilation happens during runtime. Like JavaScript or Java, where code is converted to binary at runtime.
    ðŸ”¹ Advantage: Flexible and can perform optimizations at runtime.
    ðŸ”¹ Disadvantage: Initial execution is slightly slower.

*   **AOT (Ahead-Of-Time)**: Compilation happens before execution. Like Go or C, where the output is directly a binary file.
    ðŸ”¹ Advantage: Faster execution and independent of an interpreter.
    ðŸ”¹ Disadvantage: Less flexibility for runtime optimizations.

ðŸ§  Summary:

> JIT = Compilation at runtime

> AOT = Compilation before execution
