### 🧩 **What is a Package?**

A **package** in Go is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together.
All files in that directory must have the same **package name** at the top.

Each package provides a specific functionality and can be **imported** by other packages.

### ⚙️ **What is a Module?**

A **module** is a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together as a single unit.
It’s defined by a file named `go.mod` at the root of your project.

The module system is Go’s way of managing **dependencies** (like npm for Node.js).
