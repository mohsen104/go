**What is the difference between Stack and Heap?**

*   **Stack** is used for temporary and small data (like local variables and function parameters).
    It is fast and managed automatically (it is cleared when the function ends).
*   **Heap** is used for data that has a longer lifespan (like dynamic data created with `new` or `make`).
    It is slower and requires memory management (in Go, this is handled by the Garbage Collector).

ðŸ§  Summary:

> Stack = Fast, Automatic, Short-lived

> Heap = Slower, Flexible, Longer-lived
